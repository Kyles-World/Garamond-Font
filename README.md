# Garamond

Garamond is a group of many serif typefaces, named for sixteenth-century Parisian engraver Claude Garamond, generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime.
Garamond-style typefaces are popular to this day and often used for book printing and body text.
Garamond’s types were modeled on the type that was cut for the Venetian printer, Aldus Manutius by his punch cutter Francesco Griffo in 1495 and are in what is now known as the old style of serif letter design, letters with a fairly naturalistic feeling, a handwriting with pen look but with slightly more rigid and more upright appearance.
